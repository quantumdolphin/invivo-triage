# 🧪 Human Hepatocyte Stability Assay: Interpreting CLint and t½

This document summarizes key columns and interpretation principles for **in vitro human hepatocyte intrinsic clearance (CLint)** assays. These insights are tailored for drug discovery scientists evaluating compound stability for oral exposure and metabolic liability.

## 🔬 Assay Overview

The **human hepatocyte stability assay** is used to estimate how quickly a compound is metabolized in the human liver. It mimics **first-pass hepatic metabolism** and helps predict:

- **Hepatic clearance (CLh)**
- **First-pass effect**
- **Bioavailability (F)**
- **Oral exposure**

A compound that is **rapidly metabolized in vitro** is likely to show **high clearance in vivo**, leading to short half-life and potentially low oral bioavailability.

## 📊 Key Columns in the Dataset

| Column Name | Description | Interpretation |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `Hepatocyte stability: CLint (µL/min/10^6 cells)` | Intrinsic clearance – rate of metabolism per million hepatocytes | **Higher CLint = faster metabolism** |
| `Hepatocyte stability: t 1/2 (min)` | Half-life of compound in hepatocyte incubation | **Shorter t½ = more unstable** |
| `Hepatocyte stability: Compound concentration (µM)` | Initial assay concentration | Helps detect **concentration-dependent metabolism** |
| `Hepatocyte stability: Species` | Species used (e.g., Human, Rat) | **Focus on 'Human'** for clinical relevance |

### ✅ Ideal Stability Thresholds

| Metric | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| `CLint < 10 µL/min/10⁶ cells` | **Low clearance**, metabolically stable |
| `CLint > 50 µL/min/10⁶ cells` | **High clearance**, needs optimization |
| `t½ > 60 min` | Desirable, indicates stability |
| `t½ < 30 min` | Poor stability, flag for soft spot analysis |

### 🔁 CLint vs t½

- CLint and t½ are **inversely related**.
- Approximate formula:  
  **t½ ≈ (0.693 × V) / CLint**  
  (if volume V is known)
## 🧪 Use in Drug Discovery

- **Low CLint** is preferred for oral drugs.
- **High CLint** compounds are flagged for:
  - Structural optimization
  - Metabolic soft spot identification
  - Dosing frequency adjustment

- Medicinal chemists use this data to:
  - Correlate structure with clearance
  - Guide medicinal chemistry strategies
  - Filter leads during hit-to-lead optimization

## 🔍 Next Steps (Optional)

Consider analyzing:
- Distribution of CLint and t½ values
- Compounds categorized by metabolic stability
- Outliers or time-dependent metabolism
