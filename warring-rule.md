## Waring Rule for Permeability Prediction

The **Waring Rule** is a permeability profiling guideline derived from a large set of 8,865 compounds with measured Caco-2 permeability (Papp). It provides minimum logâ€¯D thresholds that correspond to a >50% probability of high permeability, depending on the compoundâ€™s molecular weight (MW).

Unlike Lipinskiâ€™s Rule of 5 which sets upper limits, the Waring Rule defines **lower bounds for logâ€¯D** across MW bands.

### ðŸ“Š Minimum logâ€¯D Thresholds by MW Range

| Molecular Weight Range (Da) | Minimum logâ€¯D Required |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| < 300                       | > 0.5                   |
| 300â€“350                     | > 1.1                   |
| 350â€“400                     | > 1.7                   |
| 400â€“450                     | > 3.1                   |
| 450â€“500                     | > 3.4                   |
| > 500                       | > 4.5                   |

These thresholds were developed to identify compounds with a **high likelihood of Caco-2 permeability**, making them more suitable for oral administration.

In validation studies, 82% of compounds that passed these criteria showed high permeability, while 70% of those that failed had low permeability.

### ðŸ§ª How It Works

- **logâ€¯D** is used instead of logâ€¯P because it reflects the compoundâ€™s distribution at physiological pH, accounting for ionization.
- **MW** defines how strict the logâ€¯D requirement should be. As MW increases, higher lipophilicity is needed to maintain permeability.
- The rule is useful in **early screening** to rapidly eliminate compounds unlikely to have sufficient passive absorption.

### âœ… Implementation

A new column called `Waring Rule` was added to the compound descriptor table with values:

- `"Y"` for compounds meeting the MW-appropriate logâ€¯D threshold
- `"N"` for compounds falling below the threshold

This flag supports prioritizing compounds for **oral or systemic administration** in early-stage screening.
